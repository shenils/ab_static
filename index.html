          <h3>How it Works?</h3>
          <p class="excerpt">
            A musician uploads a song, for which they are paid 1 cent each time it is streamed (over 30 seconds) and one dollar for each paid download. To meet current obligations, the musician can raise money against the a portion of earnings of the song. 
          </p>
          <p>True music fans are able to use this website to find the latest and least known songs from talented musicians - at only 1 cent per play. If they love a song, and beleive that it will reach heights, fans are able to fund the artist in return for claims of the song's earnings. Once invested in a song, the fan shares the link to their network - to introduce their friends to newest and best music, as well as increase the value of their claims. Later, the fan can sell his claims to other fans who want in on the action on our easy to use marketplace.

            Why are you doing this?
          </p>
          <p>We believe that too many talented people are going unnoticed - and providing motivation for people to tell others about the incredible work is a great way for a new musician to reach a network beyond two degrees of separation.

            How does Alphabeats Music make money?
          </p>
          <p>Providing this platform is a costly affair. The way we make up for it is by taking 5 percent of transaction fees when claims of a song's income changes hands. We do not take a cut from streaming and downloads. Another revenue stream is in the form of featured song real estate. Artists are able to pay for their song to be displayed on one out of eight boxes in the home page.
